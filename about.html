                    <h4>About Me</h4>
                    <p>What can I tell about myself? What I can tell is that I'm so into computer since I like to play games and stuff and there was a time that I saw my older brother making one of his project on our family computer and I fell in love looking in to the code. Watching movies also that include some scenes about hacking made me fell in love more looking on all of that codes. That's why I want to learn to code. So that on my spare time after grinding on my computer games I can code and drink a cold cup of coffee.</p>
